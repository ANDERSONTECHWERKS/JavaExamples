 Classes that implement OOP concepts in Java

These classes and methods are a constant WIP, and their intended use is to showcase OOP 
design programs and principles written in Java.

Known issues:
- RecursiveMethods.RecursiveProduct currently broken.
This is likely to remain a known issue, as I'm trying to implement a more-difficult recursive method (using ONLY the + operator)
rather than something more conventional. The more conventional method is commented out.

Untested Methods:

The following method prototypes are untested, and do not have tests written for them.

- 	public HashSet<T> inRange(T lowerBound, T upperBound){
-	private void inRangeHelper(HashSet<T> hashSet, Node localHead, T lowerBound, T upperBound) {
- 	private void positionOfElementInListHelper(Node localHead, int pos,TreeMap<T, Integer> retTreeMap) {
- 	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
- 	private boolean equalsHelper(Node head1, Node head2) {
